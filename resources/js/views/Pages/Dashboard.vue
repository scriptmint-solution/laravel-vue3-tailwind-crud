                Until now, trying to style an article, document, or blog post
                with Tailwind has been a tedious task that required a keen eye
                for typography and a lot of complex custom CSS.
            </p>
            <p>
                By default, Tailwind removes all of the default browser styling
                from paragraphs, headings, lists and more. This ends up being
                really useful for building application UIs because you spend
                less time undoing user-agent styles, but when you
                <em>really are</em> just trying to style some content that came
                from a rich-text editor in a CMS or a markdown file, it can be
                surprising and unintuitive.
            </p>
            <p>
                We get lots of complaints about it actually, with people
                regularly asking us things like:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    Why is Tailwind removing the default styles on my
                    <code>h1</code> elements? How do I disable this? What do you
                    mean I lose all the other base styles too?
                </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                We hear you, but we're not convinced that simply disabling our
                base styles is what you really want. You don't want to have to
                remove annoying margins every time you use a
                <code>p</code> element in a piece of your dashboard UI. And I
                doubt you really want your blog posts to use the user-agent
                styles either â€” you want them to look <em>awesome</em>, not
                awful.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <code>@tailwindcss/typography</code> plugin is our attempt
                to give you what you <em>actually</em> want, without any of the
                downsides of doing something stupid like disabling our base
                styles.
            </p>
            <p>
                It adds a new <code>prose</code> class that you can slap on any
                block of vanilla HTML content and turn it into a beautiful,
                well-formatted document:
            </p>
